                    <h3>Funny Animal Stories</h3>
                        <h4>Cat and An Egg</h4>
                         <p>While some cats like to play with stuffed mice, catnip, and jingle balls, this cat likes to play with plastic Easter eggs. She picks a half up in her mouth, and trots around with it, yowling all the while, with the egg functioning as an amplifier. One year we got the kids these big eggs â€¦ and eventually, she found one and tried to play with it the same way."
                            Sadly for this cat, it didn't work out. "When she picked it up, it flipped up over face and covered her eyes. She panicked and started running around, clanging into the baseboard heaters and whatever else. It was hysterical! She finally dropped it and stood there dazed. And then she picked up the egg and did it again. And again. And again." When will they learn?</p>
