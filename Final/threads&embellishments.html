                    <h3>DMC</h3>
                    <p>DMC is manufactured in France and are a tried and trusted brand and they are still my personal thread of choice. They have 482 colors in their standard solid color palette. </p>

                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Anchor</h3>
                    <p>The Anchor brand has actually been around nearly as long as DMC. They are a quality established brand that is manufactured in Germany. Anchor currently have 460 colors in palette, they use their own numbering convention so if you are converting from DMC to Anchor you will need a conversion chart.</p>

                    <h3>Sullivan's</h3>
                    <p>Sullivan’s thread is also manufactured in China. They have 454 colors in their palette and are made from 100% Egyptian cotton. Sullivan’s have their own numbering system but each skein has the DMC conversion number actually printed on the label. Sullivans is a very reasonable price and it is nice that they list the DMC equivalent number on the label of the skein.</p>
