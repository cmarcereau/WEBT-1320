                    <h2>Aida Cloth</h2>
                    <p>Aida fabric is one of the most widely used cross stitch fabrics. Made from 100% cotton, Aida is a particularly good choice for beginners because the wide, open weave makes the holes easy to see.Aida comes in different fabric counts. A fabric's count is the number of holes per inch, which in turn determines the number of stitches per inch.Aida in 14 count is easy to find and is a good choice for stitchers who are just starting out. Other common counts are 11, 16, 18, and 20.Aida also comes in a 6-count version called Herta that is perfect for teaching children to stitch or for chunky “big stitch” projects. </p>

                    <h2>Linens</h2>
                    <p>Linen is the choice of many experienced cross stitchers for its soft hand and higher thread count. Linen is a natural cloth woven from flax fibers. Typically it is more expensive than cotton fabric like Aida.Linen can have natural irregularities like slubs and threads that vary in thickness throughout the weave of the fabric. Those irregularities can make linen more challenging to stitch on, but they also give the fabric character and offer a more traditional-looking finish.Linen is typically stitched over two and is available in a wide range of thread counts, with the most common being 28 and 32 count. Thread counts can go as high as 40 and even 50. There is also a large color range to choose from, including hand dyed and novelty prints.</p>

                    <h2>Evenweave</h2>
                    <p>“Evenweave” fabric has the same number of stitches per inch vertically and horizontally, just like aida. Typical evenweave fabric counts are 25, 28, and 32. Types of evenweave include Jobelan, Monaco Cloth, and Lugana, among many others.Evenweave is usually stitched over two fabric threads—meaning if the fabric is 28 count, each stitch will go over two threads (which will really make it 14 count). This is an important fact to keep in mind, since it will affect the size of the overall design. </p>

                    <h2>Fiddler's Cloth</h2>
                    <p>It is made of 50% cotton, 42% polyester, and 8% silk.  Fiddlers cloth comes in 18 and 14 count and is a lot like Aida fabric.  It is an inexpensive fabric and has a very rustic look to it.</p>

                    <h2>Davos</h2>
                    <p>It comes in 18 count fabric and made of 100% cotton twist yarn and it is great for all types of stitching.  It's a relatively heavy fabric and very soft, so it is ideal for clothing, pillows and other items and gives a soft supple look.  It comes in a small range of neutral colors, putty khaki being the most popular color and it has a nice drape to it.</p>

                    <h2>Hardanger</h2>
                    <p>Is made of 100% cotton and it is 22 count. Hardanger is also a method of embroidery and Hardanger fabric was designed specifically for it.  Hardanger embroidery was originally worked on 50 count Linen fabric and linen was quite expensive. Cotton Hardanger fabric is inexpensive and was a good solution for stitchers who enjoy Hardanger.</p>
